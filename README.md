## Title of the Project
EXPLORING OPENCV FOR AN OCR-ENHANCED VIRTUAL SKETCHPAD

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Air Canvas system utilizes a webcam or a camera module to capture the hand gestures of the user. OpenCV is employed for image processing tasks such as hand detection, tracking, and gesture recognition. By analyzing the movement of the hand in the captured frames, the system can interpret gestures like drawing, erasing, and selecting colors.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
Functional requirements define the specific actions or behaviours that the system must perform to fulfil its intended purpose. These requirements are categorized based on the system's functionalities:

• Hand Tracking: The system should accurately track the user's hand movements in real-time, capturing the positions and orientations of key landmarks such as fingertips and knuckles.

• Gesture Recognition: The system should distinguish between various hand gestures representing different drawing tools and actions, such as brushes, pencils, erasers, and stroke types. 

• Stroke Generation: The system should translate hand gestures into corresponding strokes on the digital canvas, adjusting stroke parameters like thickness, opacity, and color based on gesture dynamics. 

• Text Recognition: The system should incorporate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize text written in the air and convert handwritten text into editable digital text. 

• User Interface: The system should provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to control various aspects of the drawing process, such as color palettes, layer management, and undo/redo functionality


## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
**Software:**

Python: OpenCV primarily functions within Python environments. Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed (typically Python 3.x is recommended).
OpenCV Library: Install the OpenCV library using a package manager like pip (pip install opencv-python).
Optional Libraries: Depending on your approach, you might consider additional libraries like NumPy for numerical computations or MediaPipe for advanced hand pose estimation.

**Hardware:**

Computer: Any computer capable of running OpenCV and processing video streams should suffice. A webcam is essential for capturing user input.
Webcam: A webcam with a decent resolution is necessary for accurate fingertip or hand detection. Higher resolutions allow for more precise tracking.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
AirCanvas encourages creative pursuits and blurs the line between the physical and digital worlds by offering users an easy and immersive virtual canvas. By combining OCR technology, it becomes much more useful as it digitizes printed or handwritten text while sketching.
Although the goal of AirCanvas is to be a flexible tool, the project's investigation of educational uses highlights how revolutionary it could be for interactive learning.
